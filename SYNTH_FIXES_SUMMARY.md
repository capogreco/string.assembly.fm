# Synth Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Visualizer Not Showing
**Problem**: The synth-app.js was looking for `synthCore.analyser` but SynthCore has `synthCore.analyserNode`
**Fix**: Changed all references from `analyser` to `analyserNode` in drawVisualizer()

### 2. Program Undefined Error
**Problem**: Controller sends program data as `message.program` but synth was expecting `message.data`
**Fix**: Updated program handling to check both `message.program` and `message.data` for compatibility

### 3. WebRTC Connection (Previously Fixed)
**Problem**: ICE message type mismatch - server sends "ice" but synth expected "ice-candidate"
**Fix**: Added handling for both "ice" and "ice-candidate" message types

## Expected Behavior

1. **During Calibration**: 
   - Canvas should clear to dark background
   - After clicking "Calibrate Volume", pink noise plays but visualizer may not show waveform yet

2. **After Joining Instrument**:
   - Visualizer should show frequency bars when sound is playing
   - Program changes from controller should apply without errors

3. **Debug Output**:
   - Look for "[DEBUG] SynthCore initialized. analyserNode: [object AnalyserNode]" in console
   - When receiving program: "[DEBUG] Received program message:" followed by the message
   - If program applies: "[DEBUG] Applying program:" followed by the program data

## Remaining Debug Logs

The following debug logs are still active for troubleshooting:
- Program message reception and application
- Analyser node initialization
- ICE candidate errors (if any)
